## 3. Databse 
The data were kept in the online MsSQL database. For this, an online database has been created in Microsoft Azure account. All users who have access to the database have access, that is, the program can be run without the need for extra installation, but still the database creation script has been added under version control. 
A database table named Tbl Customer has been created to hold user data. For the products, 3 separate database tables named Tbl_Book, Tbl_Magazine and Tbl_Music have been created. For past orders, the Tbl_Bill and Tbl_BillProduct table have been created. The tables in the database and their relations are as follows. Database connection of the project added DbConnection class.

![database](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53192718/86369780-9256f280-bc87-11ea-9292-eb1e633184df.png)

You can set our database on your computer from [here](https://github.com/ardasdasdas/OnlineBookStore/tree/master/DatabaseCreationScript).
After creating you have to get your SQL connection string, after that you have to enter 28th column in [DbConnection.cs](https://github.com/ardasdasdas/OnlineBookStore/blob/master/OnlineBookStore/OnlineBookStore/DbConnection.cs) class.

## 4. UML

## Patterns That We Used
Since we wanted to ensure that only one object from our customer class was created in the application we will do, we applied **Singleton Design Pattern**. This customer object, which we will create in our application with **Singleton Design Pattern**, will prevent the creation of a second customer object thanks to Singleton Pattern.
While creating a User Control according to the added product in our project, we used **Factory Design Pattern** so that the user does not change the code in every choice. Added product's type determines User Control's type.
Also we could use **Proxy Design Pattern**, but we had no time.
